# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Given an assignment at an imaginary ride-share company, PyBer, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Rural, and Suburban). Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows total weekly fares for each city type. This will help the company decide where to put more funds and how.

## Results:
Below I have attached the results of the summary data that shows the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Looking at the results, we can see Urban cities bring in the most ride-share transactions compared to Rural and Suburban cities. Also, since the amount of drivers and need for drivers is so high in Urban cities, the Average Fare per Ride is lower thant the other city types. It is easy to see that Pyber is most popular in Urban cities. 

In the multiple-line graph attached below we can see how fare prices varies throughout the year. In April, it seems the fare is the lowest for Urban and Suburban cities and Rural cities plateau on their prices during this month.

## Summary 
Based on the analysis of the ride-share data, here are three business suggestions I would give to the CEO of PyBer:

1. I believe investing in advertising near local bars in the Rural areas could possibly drive sales not only in customers needing drivers, but also hiring more drivers so customers have that option in those cities. 
2. Overall, Urban cities is what is driving the sales currently so I think it wise to keep our efforts going in those cities and possibly implement a push in advertising during April since that seemed to be the slowest month for those cities. 
3. Another possibility to increase ride-sharing in Rural cities and Suburban cities as well could be to lower the fares per ride. People may be more drawn to the PyBer service if we push deals, discounts, or lower the prices overall.
